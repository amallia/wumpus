This directory contains a whole bunch of different classes for different
purposes. Each query type is realized by an extension of the Query class
(header in query.h). When you add a new query class, be sure to add a

  REGISTER_QUERY_CLASS

statement at the end of the header file and include the header file at the
beginning of query.cpp. REGISTER_QUERY_CLASS is used to inform the query
dispatcher and the internal help system of the existence of the new query
class. If you don't add the line, or don't include the header file in
query.cpp, you most likely will not be able to fully use the new query class.
