Idea: Combine merge-based indexing with sort-based indexing.

Split terms into two sets: frequent and infrequent. Postings lists for
frequent terms are build incrementally using extensible in-memory lists
(unrolled linked lists). Postings lists for infrequent terms are built
though a radix-sort step when running out of memory.

Combining the two approaches should improve cache locality and therefore
lead to better overall indexing performance.
