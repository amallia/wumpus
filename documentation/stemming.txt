Stemming is performed by the static methods of the Stemmer class, which uses
different stemmers for different languages. For English, the vanilla Porter
stemmer is used. At query time (and within the internal index structures),
stemmed terms are denoted by a leading "$" sign: "$count" refers to the
disjunction ("count"+"counts"+"counted"+"counter"+"counting"+...).

When the method

  stem(char* string, int language)

is called, the results of the stemming process are cached. Therefore, this
method is to be preferred over the methods that are responsible for the actual
stemming: stemEnglish, stemGerman, ...

Stemmer::stem(char*, int) is called by Index both at indexing time and query
time. One problem with stemming is that is approximately doubles the number
of postings in the index. However, for most input terms the Stemmer produces
the same term as output. So, we do not actually have to store the postings
for the stemmed version.

Example:

  "index" stems to "index", and "indexing" stems to "index" as well.

Since for "index", we have input == output, the postings of the term "index"
do not appear in the postings list of "$index". Therefore, when a user asks
for the postings list of the term "$index" at query time, we have to construct
it as a disjunction: "$index" = ("$index"+"index").

Although query processing performance is degradated, indexing performance is
increased by a factor \approx 1.3.


The actual amount of stemming performed at indexing time is defined by the
parameter Index::STEMMING_LEVEL.

- level 0: all stemming is performed at query time, maximimizing indexing
           performance
- level 1: some stemming is performed at indexing time; this means some
           additional effort at query time: the query "$walking" will be
           transformed into "walk"+"$walk", because "walk" is not stemmed at
           indexing time
- level 2: full stemming at indexing time (stemming results are cached to
           achieve acceptable performance); note that stemming level 2 increases
           the size of the index by almost 100%
- level 3: full stemming at indexing time; if a term is stemmable, only its
           stemmed form is kept in the final index, decreasing the total size
           of the index at the cost of decreased query-time flexibility
