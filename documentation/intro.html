		After you have downloaded the Wumpus software package and extracted all files from
		the archive ("tar xzf wumpus.tgz"), change to the wumpus/ directory and
		type in "make". This will build Wumpus and create the system executables in
		wumpus/bin/.
		<br><br>
		After the system has been built, you can start Wumpus by typing
		<blockquote>
			bin/wumpus --config=wumpus.cfg
		</blockquote>
		The additional "--config" parameter is necessary to tell wumpus what configuration
		file should be used ("wumpus.cfg"). Among other things, the configuration file defines
		the directory in which Wumpus will create its index structures. If you use the configuration
		file that came with Wumpus, you will find the index in wumpus/database/.
		<br><br>
		After you start the system, Wumpus will create a couple of files in the index directory
		and then tell you that it is ready to process your queries:
		<blockquote><pre>
@0-Index loaded. </pre></blockquote>
		You can then add files to the index and submit queries to the system. Every response to
		a query ends with a line starting with "@" that indicates whether the query was successful
		or not and also tells you how long it took Wumpus to process your query.
		<blockquote><pre>
<b>Hi Wumpus, how are you doing?</b>
@1-Syntax error. (0 ms) </pre></blockquote>
		<br>
		The next section, <a href="updates.html">Index updates and simple queries</a>, shows
		how you can add files to Wumpus' index and explains the basic query types.
